    Since 2017, I have been working at NAVER Search, where I am responsible for the SRE (Site Reliability Engineering) platform and the construction and operation of large-scale time-series databases. I have experience leading a small development team that started with just two people and grew to nine members over the course of two years. After a nine-month parental leave, I returned to work as an individual contributor rather than a team leader, continuing to work diligently. Before joining NAVER, I developed databases at TmaxSoft and researched recommendation systems in graduate school.

    My interests lie more in problem-solving than in specific technologies or domains. I believe that software and data technologies can help make it a bit easier to solve many difficult problems that arise in daily life.

        + Since 2022, I have been building and operating a large-scale, global TSDB (Time-series Database) platform. Based on the open-source TSDB [VictoriaMetrics](https://victoriametrics.com/), we collect, store, and process tens of millions to hundreds of millions of real-time time-series. More details can be found in the presentation below:

        + From 2020 to 2022, I worked as the leader of the NAVER Search SRE platform development team. The team grew from two to nine members, and we carried out projects to reorganize numerous legacy systems and data. I shared more about this experience in the presentation and interview below:

        + For about three years since 2017, I developed the SRE platform responsible for the reliability of NAVER Search. I also created a dashboard that visualizes complex, large-scale distributed systems and built a new alert system with rules not previously applied. During this period, the failure rate of NAVER Search decreased by half each year, reaching the 0% range. More details can be found in the link below:

    The interests section in a resume typically refers to a section where you can mention your hobbies, interests, and activities outside of work or school. This section can give potential employers a better idea of your personality, your values, and your interests beyond your professional experience.

    Including an interest section in your resume can be helpful if your interests are relevant to the job you are applying for, such as if you are applying for a job in a creative field and your hobbies include painting or writing. It can also be useful if you are applying for a job where teamwork or social skills are important, and you can mention interests that demonstrate those qualities.

    However, it is important to be selective when including an interest section in your resume, and to choose interests that are appropriate and professional. Avoid including controversial or potentially offensive interests, and focus on interests that showcase your positive qualities and strengths.

  title: Self-evaluation
  description: |
    The self-evaluation section in a resume is a section where you can evaluate and assess your own skills, strengths, and weaknesses. It is typically a short paragraph or bullet points at the end of your resume, which provides a personal perspective on your abilities and how they align with the requirements of the job.

    In this section, you can highlight your achievements, areas of expertise, and any unique qualities or experiences that set you apart from other candidates. You can also mention areas where you are looking to improve or gain further experience.

    A well-crafted self-evaluation section can demonstrate your self-awareness and confidence in your abilities, as well as your willingness to continuously learn and grow. However, it is important to be honest and avoid over-inflating your skills or qualifications, as this can negatively impact your credibility and the hiring manager's impression of you.

reference:

  order: 14
  title: References
  description: |
    A reference section in a resume is a list of individuals who can vouch for your skills, work ethic, and character. These individuals are typically former managers, colleagues, or mentors who have worked closely with you in the past and can provide insight into your abilities and work style.

    It's important to note that including a reference section in a resume is not always necessary, and some employers may prefer to request references separately. If you do choose to include a reference section, it should typically be located at the end of your resume.

    When listing references, be sure to include the individual's name, job title, company name, phone number, and email address. It's also a good idea to ask for the individual's permission before listing them as a reference, and to let them know what kind of job you are applying for so they can speak to your relevant skills and experience.

    It's important to choose references who can provide a positive and comprehensive evaluation of your work. Avoid listing family members or friends as references, and instead focus on individuals who can speak to your professional abilities and accomplishments.
