I am a site reliability engineer and researcher at NAVER SEARCH. My interests include time series data mining, anomaly detection, outlier analysis, and incident management. Before coming to NAVER, I was a software engineer at TmaxData and developed DBMS components, such as query compiler and executor.  I built a background in recommender systems during my graduate studies.
